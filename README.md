# SRCCommentsAutoDeleter
Will load an SRC page, logged in with a support browser's cookies, and delete all comments from every run

Config is all done in the beginning section of the script.

Since SRC implemented some actual moderation tools, this script may still be useful if someone wants to monitor all comments on a leaderboard. Otherwise I won't be updating the repo, really
